Title: Regularized composite ReLU-ReHU loss minimization with linear computation and linear convergence
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Yixuan Qiu, Ben Dai
Maintainer: Yixuan Qiu <yixuanq@gmail.com>
Description: Implementation of the 'ReHLine' solver for a broad class of
    regularized empirical risk minimization problems. 'ReHLine'
    supports any convex piecewise linear-quadratic loss functions and
    optional linear constraints. Examples of such problems include
    support vector machines, regularized quantile regressions, Huber
    regressions, etc.
